CIS 3309 Term Project – Pick a Project
This project will give you experience applying all the skills you learned in class to build a complex
software system using component-based software design principles. This project is also an exercise in
team programming where you will form a team of 2 to complete the project. Your team needs to
propose a project. The project selection is on a first-come/first-served basis and must be approved by
me. You need to provide documentation for your project, and have the documents reviewed by me
before you can begin implementing the project.
Requirements:
The requirements are based on the type of project your team develops. However, all projects must
include the following elements.
 The program must utilize a login process to allow the user to access the application’s features.
 The program requires a new account registration process to allow the user to create an account
with a user and password.
 The program should have a main start screen that allows the user to easily navigate the
application.
 The application must make use of multiple forms.
o Provide navigation between your forms.
 Provide instructions to the user on how to use the application in a separate help form.
 The program must use images to make the application more attractive and professional.
 The program must use error handling and validate all user input. Programs shouldn’t crash for
any reason.
 The application must utilize a database to store all of the data used by the application and
dynamic data binding.
o The GUI’s data should come from the database as much as possible.
o For example, if your application has a drop-down box used to choose an employee, then
the drop-down box shouldn’t have the employees added manually using the designer; it
should be done automatically with the data come from the database.
o Also, you must manually write all the code to connect to the database and manipulate it
through adding, editing, and removing data. You cannot use the DataSource control
discussed in the textbook or any other control that automates this for you.
 The project must implement component-based software design using MVC. You will be graded
on how well you organize your classes, assign responsibilities to you classes, and all other
component-based design techniques discussed in class.
o The main aspect of this project is to make use of component-based software design
concepts learned in class.
 The application must make use of dynamic data displays other than simply using a DataGridView
or ListView for the applications main display of records.
o This means your application’s main display must implement the creation and displaying
of controls dynamically at run-time instead of at design-time where you drag and drop
controls from the toolbox.
 For example, if your application involves managing a shopping cart, then you
should create the picturebox, labels, and controls used to display each item in
the cart dynamically based on the number of records in the database.
o You may still use DataGridViews and ListViews for the display of some data, but these
are only good to display text.
 You need to create UnitTests for all the classes except for the actual form classes that represent
the GUI.
o You must write the UnitTests in parallel with your classes. You must be able to
demonstrate this when asked or your project will receive credit.
Grading:
I will evaluate the project based on the documentation (planning phase) and equal division of work on
all elements, the implementation of the application and its functionalities, and how well you
implemented component-based design in creating reusable component-based code. You need to make
all the elements of the program reusable components with exception of the GUI. I will also grade you
on how well you worked as a team. Each member of the group is responsible for an equal amount of
work designing and coding the system. You shouldn’t assign the GUI to one member and everything else
is done by the other member. The work for each element (database, code, GUI, plans) should be divided
equally so that each member has done some work on each element. You must prove that you done the
work in order to receive credit.
Due:
See the assignment posting under the Assignments section on Canvas.
Submission:
You need to zip the root folder for your solution into a single zip file and submit the assignment in
Canvas. To submit the assignment, you need to click the Project’s Title “Term Project” to view the
submission form and upload the file. Note: Only one person in your team needs to submit the project.
Make sure you properly submit your assignment and that it works. Programs that don’t run or don’t
contain all the necessary files will not be graded, no exceptions.
